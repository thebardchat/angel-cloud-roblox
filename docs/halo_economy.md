|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Light Motes** | Progression | Angel Level advancement | NEVER |

## 3. Halo Sinks (Spend Targets)

| Cloud Wisp | Common | 150 | 2.5 | 1.2 |
| Stardust | Common | 150 | 2.5 | 1.2 |
| Moonbeam | Common | 150 | 2.5 | 1.2 |
| Solar Flare | Rare | 500 | 8.3 | 3.8 |

| Premium | 300–600 | Fountain, crystal chandelier, garden set |

## 4. Economy Projections

### 4.1 Weekly Earn/Spend by Player Type

| Player Type | Weekly Halos Earned | Weekly Spend Target | Net Flow |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------| 
| Casual (20 min/day) | 420 | 200–400 | Slight surplus |
| Active (45 min/day) | 910 | 500–800 | Moderate surplus |
| Dedicated (90 min/day) | 1,400 | 800–1,200 | Saving toward legendaries |

### 4.2 Time-to-Target Items

| Item | Casual | Active | Dedicated |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| First emote (100) | 1.7 days | 0.8 days | 0.5 days |
| Rare wing skin (500) | 8.3 days | 3.8 days | 2.5 days |
| Epic wing skin (1,200) | 20 days | 9.2 days | 6 days |
| Legendary wing skin (2,500) | 41.7 days | 19.2 days | 12.5 days |
| Legendary halo effect (2,000) | 33.3 days | 15.4 days | 10 days |
| "Buy everything" estimate | ~6 months | ~3 months | ~2 months |

### 4.3 Inflation Control

**Problem:** Over time, veteran players accumulate Halos with nothing to spend on.

**Solutions:**
1. **Seasonal cosmetics** — New sinks every quarter (limited-time wing skins, furniture sets)
2. **Cloud Base expansion** — Each new room = new furniture to buy
3. **Gift economy** — Future: let players buy gifts for others (Halo transfer sink)
4. **Community fund** — Future: players donate Halos toward server-wide goals (unlock a community cloud island)

**Review cadence:** Monthly. Track median Halo balance across player segments. If median exceeds 3x the most expensive item, add sinks.

## 5. Robux → Halo Conversion (Developer Products)

| Product | Robux Price | Halos Received | Halo/Robux Ratio |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Small Bundle | 49 | 500 | 10.2 |
| Medium Bundle | 99 | 1,500 | 15.2 |
| Large Bundle | 249 | 5,000 | 20.1 |

**Design:** Larger bundles give better ratios (standard practice, rewards commitment). But even the largest bundle doesn't buy a Legendary outright — you still need to earn some through play.

**Ethical Guardrail:** A player who buys the Large Bundle gets ~25 days of Active play worth of Halos. This is a boost, not a bypass. They still need to PLAY to progress (Motes are free-only).

---

## 6. Game Pass Impact on Economy

| Game Pass | Effect on Halos |
|-----------|----------------|
| Cloud Supporter (99 Robux) | +500 one-time Halos |
| Halo Boost (199 Robux) | 2x earn rate for 30 days (~double all faucets) |
| Cloud Base Expansion (149 Robux) | No direct Halo impact (unlocks slots) |
| Angel Mail Plus (49 Robux) | No direct Halo impact (unlocks messages) |

**Halo Boost ceiling:** An Active player with Boost earns ~260 Halos/day instead of 130. Still takes 9.6 days for a Legendary. Not game-breaking.

## 7. Economy Health Metrics

| Metric | Healthy Range | Red Flag |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Median Halo balance (all players) | 200–2,000 | >5,000 (inflation) or <50 (starvation) |
| % players with 0 Halos | <5% | >15% |
| Daily Halo faucet (server avg) | 50–150 per player | >300 (too generous) |
| Most popular sink | Any category | One category >60% of all spending |
| Time to first purchase | 1–3 sessions | >7 sessions (prices too high) |

---

## 8. Edge Cases & Exploits

| Scenario | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Player creates alt accounts to farm Halos | Low (Halos are cosmetic-only) | One-time rewards are per-account. Daily limits cap farming. |
| Player buys max Halo bundles Day 1 | No gameplay advantage | They get cosmetics early. Progression (Motes) still requires playing. |
| Server hop to reset trial cooldowns | Medium | Cooldowns stored in DataStore (server-persistent), not server memory. |
| AFK farming at Blessing Bluffs | Low | Blessings require active button press + 30s cooldown. No auto-earn. |
| Economy inflation over 6+ months | Medium | Quarterly sink additions (seasonal cosmetics). Monthly median balance review. Never nerf earned Halos retroactively — add new things to buy instead. |
| New player feels "behind" veteran | Low | No competitive systems. No leaderboards. Cosmetics are visible but not ranked. |

---

*Economy review: Monthly. Adjust faucets before sinks. Never nerf earned Halos retroactively.*
