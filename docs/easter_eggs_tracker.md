## 1. Easter Egg Design Rules

1. **Reward curiosity.** Every egg should feel like a discovery, not a grind.
2. **Tie to lore.** Every egg connects to Angel's story or the Angel Cloud universe.
3. **Hint, don't tell.** Clues are scattered in NPC dialogue, Lore Fragments, and environmental details.
4. **Track everything.** All eggs appear in the Collection Log (Lore Codex, press C).
5. **Community sharing.** Eggs should spark "Did you find the..." conversations.

## 2. Easter Egg Registry

### EE-001: The Founder's Loft

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | The Empyrean (Layer 6) |
| **Trigger** | Stand on the 3rd cloud platform from the western edge during in-game sunset (18:00-18:15 game time) + perform the "Reflect" emote |
| **What happens** | A hidden path materializes — glowing stepping stones leading to a door in a cloud wall. Path visible for 30 seconds. |
| **Reward** | Lore Scroll #7 ("The First Cloud") + "Dreamer" exclusive wing skin + 100 Halos |
| **Hints** | NPC "The Keeper" in Layer 1 says: "The founders walked on light when the sun kissed the clouds goodbye." Lore Fragment #42 mentions "the third step where the sun rests." |
| **Difficulty** | Hard — requires reaching Layer 6 + timing + specific emote |

### EE-002: Cloud 9

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | The Meadow (Layer 2) |
| **Trigger** | Find and stand on the 9th floating island. Islands have subtle numbering embedded in cloud texture patterns (swirl count = number). |
| **What happens** | Island glows golden. Music shifts to a dreamy track. Camera does a slow 360° pan. |
| **Reward** | "Cloud 9" emote (floating happy dance) + 100 Halos |
| **Hints** | Community Board sometimes displays: "Have you counted the clouds in the Meadow?" A Lore Fragment mentions "the ninth cloud where joy lives." |
| **Difficulty** | Medium — requires observation and counting |

### EE-003: The First Breath

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | The Stormwall (Layer 4), Wind Temple |
| **Trigger** | Complete an entire Wind Temple run (5 Wind Crystals) without taking any storm damage |
| **What happens** | After final crystal, the storm parts completely. Silence. A single beam of light hits the player. Special cinematic: wings briefly transform into pure wind. |
| **Reward** | "Windwalker" exclusive wing trail effect + bonus Lore Fragment ("The Calm After") + 100 Halos |
| **Hints** | Temple entrance NPC: "The ancient ones could walk through storms untouched." Lore Fragment about "breathing so perfectly the wind couldn't find you." |
| **Difficulty** | Hard — requires mastering the breathing/wind mechanic with no mistakes |

### EE-004: Angel's Whisper

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | The Nursery (Layer 1), Reflection Pool |
| **Trigger** | Stand completely still at the Reflection Pool for 60 real seconds. No input. No movement. Just... be still. |
| **What happens** | At 60 seconds, the ambient music fades and is replaced by a unique piano melody. The pool's surface shows a brief reflection of angel wings larger than the player's current tier. A soft text appears: "Be still. You are enough." |
| **Reward** | "Patience" badge + 50 Halos + the special ambient track plays whenever the player visits any Reflection Pool afterward |
| **Hints** | The Keeper says: "Sometimes the pool shows things to those who wait." Lore Fragment #3 references "the patience of still water." |
| **Difficulty** | Easy to trigger, hard to discover — requires doing NOTHING in a game about doing things |

### EE-005: The Chain Unbroken

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Any Blessing Bluff (any layer) |
| **Trigger** | Be part of a Blessing Chain that reaches 10 or more consecutive players |
| **What happens** | Golden light erupts from the Bluff. A chain of visible light connects all 10+ participants wherever they are on the server. Celebration sound plays for all. Community Board updates: "THE CHAIN UNBROKEN — [count] angels linked!" |
| **Reward** | "Chain Link" exclusive halo cosmetic (golden chain ring) + 200 Halos for ALL participants in the chain |
| **Hints** | Blessing Bluffs have a chain counter visible to all. NPC dialogue: "They say when enough angels give without asking, the light connects them all." |
| **Difficulty** | Medium-Hard — requires 10 consecutive players to all bless without breaking. Community coordination. |

### EE-006: Stargazer

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | The Luminance (Layer 5), Crystal Codex Room |
| **Trigger** | Open the Lore Codex (C key) inside the Crystal Codex Room with all 65 Lore Fragments collected |
| **What happens** | Full cinematic (60 seconds): The constellation map lifts off the screen, surrounds the player as a 3D star field. Each star speaks its fragment in sequence (abbreviated). The final star reveals Angel's complete story. Player floats in space. Stars form the shape of angel wings. Fade to white. Return to game with permanent "Stargazer" badge. |
| **Reward** | "Stargazer" exclusive wing skin (prismatic constellation pattern) + "Stargazer" badge + 500 Halos |
| **Hints** | Every layer has an NPC that mentions "the full constellation." Lore Codex shows empty star slots. The drive to complete is the hint. |
| **Difficulty** | Very Hard — requires collecting ALL 65 Lore Fragments across all 6 layers. This is the ultimate achievement. |

### EE-007: The Hidden Floor

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Between Layers 3 and 4 (The Canopy / The Stormwall transition) |
| **Trigger** | While ascending between layers, fly into a specific cloud formation that flashes briefly during a lightning strike. Timing window: 0.5 seconds during the flash. |
| **What happens** | Player passes through the cloud wall into a tiny secret room. Inside: a developer message on the wall ("Built with love for every kid who needs a game that builds them up. — The Angel Cloud Team"), a miniature model of the entire game world, and a glowing chest. |
| **Reward** | "Explorer" badge + 100 Halos + "Tiny World" Cloud Base decoration (miniature of the game world) |
| **Hints** | Extremely subtle. One Lore Fragment mentions "the space between storms and trees." Lightning in that zone occasionally illuminates a door-shaped outline in a cloud. Requires sharp eyes and good timing. |
| **Difficulty** | Very Hard — precision timing + awareness + flight ability (Layer 5+ recommended) |
