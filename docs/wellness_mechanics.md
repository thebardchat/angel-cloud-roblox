# Angel Cloud: The Cloud Climb — Wellness Mechanics Mapping

> **Last updated:** February 27, 2026
> **Version:** 1.0
> **Principle:** The game IS the therapy. If a player notices it's therapeutic, we've failed the design.

---

## 1. Design Philosophy

Every wellness mechanic follows three rules:

1. **Fun first.** Remove the therapeutic intent and the mechanic must still be fun.
2. **No labels.** Never tell the player what skill they're practicing. No tooltips saying "This teaches breathing!"
3. **Opt-in depth.** Surface level = pure fun. Deeper engagement = greater therapeutic benefit. Both are valid.

## 2. Mechanic-to-Therapy Mapping

### 2.1 Diaphragmatic Breathing → Wind Channeling

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Wind Channeling in the Stormwall (Layer 4) |
| **Player experience** | "I channel wind energy to fight storms and power crystals" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Paced diaphragmatic breathing (4-count inhale, 4-count exhale) |
| **How it works** | Hold button = inhale (character charges with visible wind energy, 4 seconds). Release = exhale (energy releases as a wind burst, 4 seconds). Successful cycle = Wind Crystal earned. 5 crystals = Temple complete. |
| **Dosage** | 5 breathing cycles per Temple run (~40 seconds of paced breathing) |
| **Evidence base** | Diaphragmatic breathing reduces cortisol, activates parasympathetic nervous system. Meta-analysis: Ma et al., 2017 (Frontiers in Psychology) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | They're fighting a storm. The breathing is a POWER, not an exercise. |

### 2.2 Emotional Recognition → Echo Chamber Trial

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Sound-matching puzzle in the Meadow (Layer 2) |
| **Player experience** | "I match these weird tones to solve the puzzle" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Identifying emotions from tonal/prosodic cues |
| **How it works** | Trial plays emotional audio tones (happy, sad, anxious, calm, angry, surprised). Player selects matching "emotion crystal" from 4 options. 8 rounds per trial. No wrong answers — different matches reveal different Lore Fragments. |
| **Dosage** | 8 emotion-identification decisions per trial run |
| **Evidence base** | Emotion recognition training improves social cognition in children. Trentacosta & Fine, 2010 (Developmental Review) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | It's an audio puzzle. The crystals are cool. They want the Lore Fragment. |

### 2.3 Gratitude Practice → Angel Mail

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Pre-written positive message system (Layer 2+) |
| **Player experience** | "I'm thanking that player who helped me cross the bridge" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Gratitude expression, positive social reinforcement |
| **How it works** | Player selects from curated messages, picks a recipient, sends. Recipient gets sparkle notification + 2 Halos. Sender gets 5 Halos per 3 unique recipients/day. |
| **Dosage** | 3+ gratitude expressions per session (incentivized by Halo reward) |
| **Evidence base** | Gratitude interventions increase wellbeing and reduce depression. Emmons & McCullough, 2003 (JPSP) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | It's a social feature. They're being nice for Halos and because it feels good. |

### 2.4 Self-Regulation / Energy Management → Wing Gauge

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Stamina bar for flight/glide (Layer 3+) |
| **Player experience** | "I need to manage my flight energy so I don't crash" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Self-regulation awareness, energy/burnout management |
| **How it works** | Wing Gauge depletes during flight/glide, recovers when grounded or at Reflection Pools. Color-coded feedback. Players learn to pace themselves and seek recovery zones. |
| **Dosage** | Continuous during all flight gameplay |
| **Evidence base** | Self-regulation is a core executive function. Games teaching resource management improve self-regulation in children. Diamond & Lee, 2011 (Science) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | Every game has stamina bars. This one just happens to teach pacing. |

### 2.5 Healthy Boundaries → HALT System

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Hidden anti-burnout system (Layer 3+) |
| **Player experience** | "My gauge seems to drain faster... maybe I'll take a break" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Screen time awareness, self-care boundary setting |
| **How it works** | After 45 min continuous play, Wing Gauge drains 20% faster. Reflection Pools glow brighter (visual cue to rest). After 90 min, NPC comment. After 120 min, gentle UI banner. Never blocks play. |
| **Dosage** | Passive, session-length |
| **Evidence base** | Screen time breaks improve attention and reduce fatigue. AAP recommendations for children's media use. |
| **Why kids won't notice** | The gauge just feels harder. Pools look inviting. It's a subtle nudge, not a wall. |

### 2.6 Decision-Making → Garden of Choices Trial

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Branching scenario puzzle (Layer 3) |
| **Player experience** | "My choices unlocked a different path than my friend's!" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Decision-making practice, consequence awareness, cognitive flexibility |
| **How it works** | Player faces 5 story scenarios with 2-3 response options. No "wrong" answers. Different choices lead to different rooms with different Lore Fragments. Players want to replay to see all paths. |
| **Dosage** | 5 decision points per trial |
| **Evidence base** | CBT-informed decision-making exercises improve cognitive flexibility. Kenney & Walsh-Blair, 2012 (Clinical Social Work Journal) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | It's a choose-your-own-adventure puzzle. The branching IS the game. |

### 2.7 Self-Reflection / Cognitive Reappraisal → The Mirror Trial

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Solo trial revisiting past choices (Layer 5) |
| **Player experience** | "I'm seeing my old choices and deciding if I'd do it differently" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Cognitive reappraisal (CBT core technique), self-reflection |
| **How it works** | The Mirror presents shadow versions of the player's Garden of Choices decisions. Player can affirm or change their response. Changed responses unlock new Lore Fragments. No judgment either way. |
| **Dosage** | 5 reflection points per trial |
| **Evidence base** | Cognitive reappraisal reduces negative affect and improves emotional regulation. Gross, 2002 (Review of General Psychology) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | It's a cool mirror dimension that references their earlier gameplay. Feels like the game remembers them. |

### 2.8 Trust & Vulnerability → Bridge of Trust Trial

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Cooperative bridge crossing (Layer 2) |
| **Player experience** | "We both have to stand on the panels or they disappear!" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Trust-building, interdependence, asking for help |
| **How it works** | Bridge panels only stay solid when 2+ players are on adjacent panels. Single player = panel fades. Requires coordination and trust. |
| **Dosage** | 3-5 minute cooperative exercise |
| **Evidence base** | Cooperative games build trust and prosocial behavior. Greitemeyer & Cox, 2013 (PSPB) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | It's a co-op platforming challenge. The fun is in the teamwork. |

### 2.9 Generosity / Pay-It-Forward → Blessing System

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Blessing Bluffs + Guardian Duty (Layers 1-6) |
| **Player experience** | "I leave a light for the next player and our chain is at 7!" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Altruism, generosity, community connection |
| **How it works** | Leave a light at a Bluff (free, 30s cooldown). Next visitor gets +2 Motes. Chains of 3+ give all participants +5 bonus. Chains of 10+ trigger Easter Egg. Guardian Duty (Layer 6) lets Angels bless entire layers. |
| **Dosage** | Optional but incentivized. Average 2-5 blessings per session. |
| **Evidence base** | Prosocial behavior increases wellbeing in children. Layous et al., 2012 (PLOS ONE) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | It's a chain mechanic like combo multipliers. They want the big chain number. |

### 2.10 Journaling / Self-Narrative → Lore Codex

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Constellation map collectible viewer (press C) |
| **Player experience** | "I'm connecting my fragment collection and seeing the full story" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Self-narrative construction, reflection, meaning-making |
| **How it works** | Collected Lore Fragments appear as stars in a constellation map. Players review fragments, see connections, piece together Angel's story — and implicitly reflect on their own journey through the game. |
| **Dosage** | Self-directed. Available anytime via C key. |
| **Evidence base** | Narrative therapy and life story work improve identity coherence and wellbeing. White & Epston, 1990 |
| **Why kids won't notice** | It's a collectible tracker with a cool star map UI. They want to fill it in. |

### 2.11 Perspective-Taking → Lightning Lookouts

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Vantage points in the Stormwall (Layer 4) |
| **Player experience** | "Whoa, I can see everything from up here!" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Perspective-taking, recognizing personal growth |
| **How it works** | High platforms with panoramic views of all layers below. Lore Fragments at these points reflect on distance traveled. Camera zooms out to show the full world. |
| **Dosage** | 3 lookout points in Layer 4 |
| **Evidence base** | Perspective-taking improves empathy and reduces distress. Galinsky et al., 2005 (JPSP) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | The view is genuinely cool. The moment feels cinematic and earned. |

### 2.12 Mentorship / Teaching → Mentor Ring

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Mentor matching system (Layer 5+) |
| **Player experience** | "I got matched with a new player and I'm showing them the ropes" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Prosocial behavior, purpose, generativity, teaching skills |
| **How it works** | Opt-in system. Guardian Angels get matched with Newborn/Young Angel players. Mentors earn bonus Halos and exclusive glow effects while actively near their mentee. |
| **Dosage** | 10+ minute sessions, self-directed |
| **Evidence base** | Peer mentoring improves wellbeing in both mentor and mentee. DuBois et al., 2011 (JCCP) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | They're earning Halos and showing off their knowledge. Helping IS the game. |

### 2.13 Mindful Pause / Grounding → Reflection Pools

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Stamina recovery zones in every layer |
| **Player experience** | "I'll rest at this pool, my gauge is low" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Grounding, mindful pausing, recognizing need for rest |
| **How it works** | Shimmering water pools that restore Wing Gauge at 3x normal rate. Ambient sound shifts to calming audio. Camera gently pulls back. Standing still for 60s at the Nursery pool triggers Easter Egg #4. |
| **Dosage** | Player-initiated, multiple times per session |
| **Evidence base** | Mindfulness-based stress reduction effective for children. Zenner et al., 2014 (Mindfulness) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | It's a recharge station. Every game has them. This one just happens to feel really peaceful. |

### 2.14 Creative Expression → Cloud-Shaping & Cloud Base

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Game mechanic** | Environment molding (Layer 3+) and personal island decoration |
| **Player experience** | "I'm building my dream cloud house and making paths for other players" |
| **Therapeutic function** | Creative expression, self-identity, environmental mastery |
| **How it works** | Cloud-Shaping: mold small platforms in the Canopy that persist for the session. Cloud Base: decorate personal island with furniture, colors, layouts. |
| **Dosage** | Self-directed, open-ended |
| **Evidence base** | Creative expression in games supports identity development. Granic et al., 2014 (American Psychologist) |
| **Why kids won't notice** | Building and decorating is intrinsically fun. See: Minecraft, Bloxburg, Adopt Me houses. |

## 3. Wellness Dosage Per Session

A typical 30-minute Active session naturally includes:

| Mechanic | Approximate Exposure | Therapeutic Function |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Wing Gauge management | Continuous | Self-regulation |
| 1 Reflection Pool visit | 30-60 seconds | Mindful pause |
| 2-3 Angel Mails sent | 1-2 minutes | Gratitude |
| 1-2 Blessings given | 30 seconds | Generosity |
| 1 Wind Temple run (if Layer 4+) | 3-5 minutes | Breathing practice |
| Lore Codex review | 1-2 minutes | Self-narrative |
| Cooperative Bridge/Trial | 3-5 minutes | Trust/teamwork |

**Total therapeutic exposure per session: ~10-15 minutes out of 30 — and the player thinks they just played a cool game.**

## 4. Safety Guardrails

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|
| Player avoids all wellness mechanics | Fine. The game is still fun. No forced participation. |
| Player triggers crisis keywords | Settings menu contains age-appropriate resources. Never a popup. |
| Wellness mechanic feels preachy | Redesign immediately. If ONE playtester says "this feels like a lesson," it's wrong. |
| Player uses Angel Mail negatively | Pre-written only. No custom text. All messages are positive. |
| HALT system feels punishing | It never blocks gameplay. Only subtle friction. Pools glow brighter as invitation. |

*If it feels like therapy, redesign it. If it feels like fun, ship it.*
